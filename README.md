<p align="center"><sub>The demo fills a sample fortnight under its own storage key and throws it away when you leave. It never touches a real plan.</sub></p>

## Install

- **iPhone / iPad** - open the link in Safari, then Share → Add to Home Screen
- **Android** - open it in Chrome, then ⋮ → Install app
- **Desktop** - Chrome and Edge show an install icon in the address bar

After that it runs full screen, works with no connection, and keeps its data on that device.

## What it does

- Stamps a **template** onto a day, so the morning does not start from a blank list
- Draws the day as a **timeline**, with free time labelled and a line at now
- Adds a task from one line: the time and the length are already filled in, you type the title
- **Replans** a broken day in one press: something came up - on today or any day this week, with one line saying when you are still free - shift the rest, or away and back
- Has a **low day** for when you do not feel like it: the key tasks stay at 40% of their length, the routine stays, the rest waits for tomorrow, and the day is scored on the key tasks alone
- Times a **step** of a task from its own line - "Meditation 10 min" - with the one timer the app has, and ticks the step when the bell rings
- Keeps a **week view**, a **library** of books and series worked through a session at a time - finish one and it says what the queue moved on to - and a **review** of how the weeks went, with one reading of where the plan and the week disagreed and, beside each repeating block, how many of the last 7 and 30 days it happened on
- Takes a **note** in one line from any screen, holds **pictures** in it - paste a screenshot, drag one in, or use the camera - and turns any note into a task with its editor already open
- Keeps a **journal** that asks nothing and counts nothing: a day, one box, no questions, saving as you type, with the month copied as markdown for anywhere else
- Never scores a bad day against you: no points, no badges, no red, no streak on the day view

<details>
<summary><strong>The longer list</strong></summary>

- A template per weekday, so a new day opens already set up. A stamp by hand always wins
- Repeating tasks: daily, weekdays or weekly, made into real tasks you can tick and move
- Quick-add: a time control, the words, a length. "14:00 Call mom 45min" parses too, and the controls redraw to match
- Three shelves for what is not on the day: notes (one key, nothing asked), Later - a list with no dates and no ages, in the order you would pull from it - and a float on a day with no time
- Push twice, then decide: an unfinished task moves to tomorrow twice, after that you finish it, drop it, or mark it ongoing
- What yesterday left, said once in a banner, moved forward in one tap, never on its own
- An evening close: one sentence about the day, half an hour before the sleep that ends it - on a date with no kind of day, at a time you set - or when the last thing is ticked. It never mentions what was not done
- North: your own text, read every morning - short lines in blocks, a line in capitals a heading whose lines open on a hover or a tap, and the headings in a row under the day's title - and under it up to four directions with a why and no progress bar, what you do to deserve each one, and the moments that pull you off it. Nothing measured, ever
- Focus: the running task, its own planned time, a ring, a way out. Not a pomodoro
- A timer and a stopwatch that survive a refresh and run on every tab
- Task detail: exact minute, note, sub-steps, repeat, the three-a-day key mark
- Six categories, one colour each, the same on the card and on the timeline block
- Day types and core tasks, so a twelve-hour shift is not scored like an ordinary Tuesday
- Sleep as a named schedule, greyed on the grid and counted out of free time
- A month calendar that fits without scrolling, and a week of one shared timeline
- External calendars as a read-only layer that free time counts: an .ics file needs nothing, a live feed needs the sync server to fetch it
- A keyboard layer with a card behind `?`, and Ctrl-K for commands and search
- A tour of nine steps, each ending when you actually do the thing
- Three themes - Dark, Light, Midnight - with every text token gated against every ground it sits on at WCAG AA, by a test
- Installs as a PWA, works offline, updates in the background with a quiet Reload notice

## Your data

The plan lives in `localStorage` on the device, as one JSON object; a few device-local preferences sit beside it under their own keys, and the daily snapshots in IndexedDB. Four ways it does not get lost:

- **Export and import** - Settings has a plain JSON backup, both ways. A backup from any earlier version still imports
- **Daily snapshots** - a full copy once a day in IndexedDB, the last seven kept, restorable from Settings
- **A copy on GitHub** - Settings → Backup takes a private repo and a fine-grained token, and writes the whole plan there as JSON after the day closes and on the first open of a new day. The token stays on the device. Each copy is merged into the one before it, so no device's backup is older than another's; Restore from cloud first brings back what is missing and touches nothing newer
- **Sync between your devices** - optional, through the same GitHub repo or a small server you host. A phone joining takes the computer's plan, or asks which to keep; nothing older is ever written over something newer - see [docs/SYNC.md](docs/SYNC.md). Below

Deleting a task or a note, removing a library item, stamping a template, moving a block to another day and a replan can each be undone for five seconds.

<details>
<summary><strong>Sync between your devices</strong></summary>

There is no hosted service and no account.

**Through your GitHub repo** there is nothing to run. With the backup's repo and token on both devices: Settings → Sync → Your GitHub repo → Turn on, on the computer first. A phone with nothing of its own takes the computer's plan; one with a plan of its own asks which to keep before anything is written. Each change goes up a few seconds after it is made, and every open, return and minute on screen reads what the other device left. Settings → Sync shows when this device last pulled and pushed, what waits to go, and says so when it is behind. How it works, and what to do when a device shows an older copy: [docs/SYNC.md](docs/SYNC.md).

**Or a server of your own**, of under three hundred lines, on a machine you own.

```bash
node server/sync-server.mjs
```

On first run it writes `data/token.txt`, prints the token, and listens on port 8787. Options: `--port`, `--data <dir>`, and `--origin <url>` to allow an origin beyond localhost and `https://quicasha.github.io`.

On each device: Settings → Sync, paste the server address and that token, turn it on. It pulls when you open the app, pushes a couple of seconds after each change, and retries on its own when the connection comes back.

**From a phone**, do not open the port to the internet. Install [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) on the PC and the phone, sign both into the same account, and put a certificate in front of the server:

```bash
tailscale serve --bg 8787
```

That prints an `https://your-pc.your-tailnet.ts.net` address, which is what goes in the server field. The address has to be https: the app is served over HTTPS, and a page on HTTPS is not allowed to call an HTTP endpoint.

**To run it at logon on Windows**, no window:

```bash
schtasks /create /tn "Dienius sync" /tr "node \"C:\path\to\dienius\server\sync-server.mjs\"" /sc onlogon /rl highest
```

Merging is per entity, so a morning on the phone and an evening on the PC both survive; the same task edited on both keeps the later edit. Deletes stick. If the server ever answers with something that is not a plan, nothing local is touched and Settings says so. Snapshots and the timer do not sync.

</details>

## Under the hood

React 19 and TypeScript, built with Vite. No UI framework, no router, no state library. The whole state is one object behind `useSyncExternalStore`, saved straight to `localStorage`. Everything that is not a component - parsing, sorting, scoring, stamping, capacity, the timeline's geometry, iCalendar - is a plain function in `src/lib` or beside its widget, tested directly.

- `src/lib` holds the data model (`types.ts`), the store (`store.ts`, eleven area modules under `store/`), the storage boundary and its validator, sync, the calendar reader, the tour as data
- `src/widgets/day-plan` is the day view: quick-add, the timeline grid, capacity, replan, the task detail sheet
- `src/views` is every other tab, the week view, the tour engine, the shared controls
- `server/sync-server.mjs` is the optional sync server; `scripts/` builds the service worker's cache list and the README's screenshots, and holds the measuring sweep and the sample day it runs on

The suite is Vitest and Testing Library for the pure modules and the views, and Playwright against the production build for the flows that cross tabs. Alongside them, `npm run sweep` opens every screen at three window sizes in both themes on a realistic full day and measures what a person would actually hit - text that does not fit, a control with something on top of it, two pieces of text over each other, contrast against whatever is really painted underneath. It plants its own defects on request to prove it can still see them. Every push and pull request runs the tests and the build; a push to `main` also publishes to GitHub Pages when both pass. The browser tests run in a job of their own.

The map of the whole thing is [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev       # dev server at localhost:5173
npm test          # vitest, watch mode
npm run e2e       # playwright against the production build (npx playwright install chromium, once)
npm run shots     # the README's screenshots, from the demo under a pinned clock
npm run sweep     # every screen measured at four desktop sizes in both themes (after npm run build)
npx tsc --noEmit  # typecheck
npm run build     # typecheck, build, then generate the service worker
```

Requires Node 22 or newer.

## Docs

- [`docs/DAILY.md`](docs/DAILY.md) - for using it rather than building it: setting it up once, and what to do if something looks wrong
- [`docs/STATE.md`](docs/STATE.md) - where the project is: the freeze, every feature in a line, what is owed, what will bite you
- [`docs/HISTORY.md`](docs/HISTORY.md) - how it got here, version by version
- [`docs/BACKLOG.md`](docs/BACKLOG.md) - what was asked for: parked, done, and no longer relevant
- [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) - where the code is: the data model, the state flow, which file for which job
- [`docs/CONVENTIONS.md`](docs/CONVENTIONS.md) - how work is done here, and why each rule exists
- [`docs/DECISIONS.md`](docs/DECISIONS.md) - the harder calls, with what each one costs
- [`docs/RESEARCH-ADHD.md`](docs/RESEARCH-ADHD.md) - the evidence behind the push rule and the score, and what not to build
- [`docs/AUDIT-v2.9.md`](docs/AUDIT-v2.9.md) - the whole app in one read, for somebody who has not seen it: every screen and where you press, screenshots in both themes, what is known to be imperfect, and what would be decided differently

## License

**[MIT](LICENSE)**.

In one sentence: take it, change it, ship it, sell it. No permission needed
and nothing owed. Keep the copyright line and the license text with any copy
you pass on, and take it as it is - there is no warranty of any kind.

Code and documentation are both covered. So are the screenshots: every one
of them is of the demo's own sample fortnight under a pinned clock, so there
is nothing personal in them and they travel with the rest.

If you build something out of this, a link back is welcome and not required.

/**
 * The geometry of the day's timeline: which anchors draw where, what is
 * free between them, and how many pixels a minute is. Pure functions, no
 * React, no notion of "now" except `currentMinutes` at the bottom, and
 * every one of them tested directly in timelineLayout.test.ts - jsdom has
 * no layout, so nothing here may depend on the DOM.
 *
 * Read this first; the rest of the file is the detail behind it.
 *
 * ## Two coordinate systems
 *
 * - **Clock minutes.** Minutes from midnight, 0 to 1440 (`DAY_MINUTES`), the
 *   same unit `capacity.ts` uses. A task's `time` becomes `startMinutes`;
 *   a window is an `Interval` of them; every "where" question is asked in
 *   these first.
 * - **Pixels down the grid.** `computeVerticalLayout` turns clock minutes
 *   into a y position with `topPx(minutes)`. The map is piecewise-linear,
 *   not proportional: the drawn segments (an anchor cluster, the gap between
 *   two clusters, the buffer at each end) each get at least their own pixel
 *   floor, and a segment stretched to its floor pushes everything after it
 *   down by the same amount. So two minutes an hour apart are not always
 *   the same distance apart in pixels, and nothing outside this module may
 *   convert one to the other by multiplying - go through `topPx`, and back
 *   through `minutesAt` on the drag side.
 *
 * ## Three windows, and why they disagree at the edges
 *
 * - `computeCapacity`'s window is the waking day (07:00-23:00 by default),
 *   a fixed clock boundary the capacity sentence is answerable to.
 * - `window` here is the anchors' own span with an hour of air each side -
 *   first anchor minus `DISPLAY_BUFFER_MINUTES` to last anchor plus the same.
 *   Gaps are computed against this one, and only between two anchors; the
 *   buffer is never a gap.
 * - `displayWindow` is `window` pulled toward the sleep boundary when that is
 *   near enough to be worth a greyed band (`extendTowardSleepBoundary`). The
 *   grid draws hour marks, anchors, gaps and `sleepBands` against this one.
 *
 * ## Invariants the drawing code relies on
 *
 * - `anchors` are sorted by start; overlapping ones share a cluster and are
 *   packed into `column` of `columns` (`assignColumns`, `packCluster`), and a
 *   cluster has one vertical extent for all its members.
 * - A sized anchor's `endMinutes` is its real end unless the window clipped
 *   it (`clippedEnd`); an unsized anchor has no `endMinutes` and draws at
 *   `UNSIZED_ANCHOR_MINUTES` - never an invented duration.
 * - Any unsized anchor suppresses every gap for the day (`gaps` is empty),
 *   because its true end is unknown, and the caller passes a gap floor of 0
 *   so no room is reserved for a button that will not exist.
 * - `topPx` is monotonic: a later minute is never higher on the grid.
 * - `fitPxPerMinute` only ever returns a density at which the whole
 *   `displayWindow` fits the room it was given, or the base density when
 *   the floors alone exceed that room - in which case the column scrolls.
 *
 * ## Where each thing is decided
 *
 * | Question | Function |
 * |---|---|
 * | Which anchors, which gaps, which window | `computeTimelineLayout` |
 * | Where the sleep band goes, if anywhere | `extendTowardSleepBoundary` |
 * | Which column an overlapping anchor takes | `assignColumns`, `packCluster` |
 * | Minute to pixel, with the floors | `computeVerticalLayout` |
 * | How dense the wide grid draws | `fitPxPerMinute` (fit the room), `chooseWidePxPerMinute` (spend a surplus) |
 * | Which hour labels have room to be drawn | `legibleHourLabels` |
 * | The hour and half-hour rules | `hourMarks`, `halfHourMarks` |
 * | Snapping a drag to five minutes | `snapToStep` |
 * | Formatting a clock or a range for a card | `formatClock`, `formatAnchorTimeRange` |
 *
 * The constants at the top are display choices, each with the reason it is
 * that number; `TimelineGrid.tsx` owns the touch-target floors and the base
 * density, and hands them in.

 * Turns a day's tasks into the grid's read-only layout: which anchors draw

 *
 * **This window is not `computeCapacity`'s window, and the two are meant
 * to disagree at the edges.** `computeCapacity` measures free time against
 * a fixed waking window (07:00-23:00, or 13:00-24:00 on a night day) - a
 * real clock boundary the capacity line's arithmetic is answerable to, so
 * "Free: 1h20 across 3 gaps" means something specific and stable. This
 * grid instead answers "what does today's shape actually look like,"
 * cropped tightly to where anchors exist: first anchor's start minus one
 * hour to last anchor's end plus one hour. A day whose first anchor is at
 * 09:00 draws a window starting at 08:00 even though the capacity window
 * opened at 07:00 - that missing hour was real free time by the capacity
 * line's own arithmetic, and this grid deliberately does not draw it,
 * because showing it would mean either inventing a fourth "gap" object
 * that dangles off the top edge with nothing on the other side of it, or
 * quietly padding the window back out toward 00:00-23:59, which is exactly
 * the wall of empty rows section 5 rules out. The one-hour buffer this
 * window keeps on each side is air for the eye, not a claim about free
 * time - it never becomes a `TimelineGap`. Only the stretches strictly
 * between two anchors do, matching section 5's own example of a gap ("a
 * 90-minute hole between the shift and the gym").
 *
 * An anchor with no `minutes` is drawn, at its real start time, but never
 * with an invented duration - see `UNSIZED_ANCHOR_MINUTES`. Because its
 * true end is unknown, it might run through what would otherwise look
 * like free time, so exactly like `computeCapacity`, an unsized anchor
 * suppresses every gap for the day rather than let one be drawn around a
 * span that anchor could actually occupy.
 *
 * **`displayWindow` and `sleepBands` are a second, later addition to this
 * same window, not a replacement of the reasoning above.** `window` itself
 * is untouched by either - gap arithmetic still runs against exactly the
 * anchor-buffered interval this comment already describes. `displayWindow`
 * is `window`, pulled back toward the day's own waking-window boundary
 * (`windowFor` in capacity.ts, driven by the day's own sleep schedule)
 * whenever the anchors already leave the boundary within a short reach -
 * see `extendTowardSleepBoundary` for the exact rule and why it is capped.
 * The grid draws hour marks, anchors, gaps and the greyed sleep band all
 * against `displayWindow`, so the two windows can differ - one more
 * instance of this module's own window deliberately disagreeing with
 * another at the edges, the same relationship this comment already
 * describes between this window and `computeCapacity`'s.
 */
/**
 * Pulls one edge of `window` back toward `boundary` (the matching edge of
 * the day's own waking window) far enough that the resulting sleep band is
 * a real, legible region - `SLEEP_BAND_MIN_MINUTES` deep - rather than
 * however much (or little) the anchor buffer happened to leave behind on
 * its own.
 *
 * Two questions, answered separately:
 *
 * - **Is the band already deep enough?** `alreadyPastBoundary` is how far
 *   `edge` already sits on the sleep side of `boundary` - zero if it has
 *   not reached the boundary at all yet. Once that is at least
 *   `SLEEP_BAND_MIN_MINUTES`, nothing here does anything: the buffer's own
 *   position already earns a real band, sometimes a deeper one than the
 *   minimum, and there is no reason to shrink it back down to exactly the
 *   floor.
 * - **Is the boundary close enough to reach at all?** `gapToBoundary` is
 *   how far `edge` sits on the *awake* side of `boundary`, still needing to
 *   be crossed before any band can start. Bridging that gap draws pure
 *   empty space with nothing in it - real anchors on one side, the sleep
 *   band on the other, nothing between - so it only happens up to
 *   `SLEEP_BAND_BRIDGE_CAP_MINUTES`. Past that, the day's real content is
 *   too far from this boundary to be worth forcing a band at all: the
 *   "wall of empty rows" the anchor buffer itself already exists to avoid,
 *   and the same risk of compressing a wide-screen day's real content that
 *   comes from inflating `displayWindow`'s own total minutes for no real
 *   gain (see `chooseWidePxPerMinute` in TimelineGrid.tsx, which divides
 *   available pixels by this window's width).
 *
 * When both checks pass, the edge is pulled all the way to
 * `SLEEP_BAND_MIN_MINUTES` past the boundary - not just far enough to close
 * `gapToBoundary` - so every band this function ever draws is the same
 * legible depth, regardless of exactly how close the anchors happened to
 * land.

/**
 * Pixel positions for every clock-minutes value in the window, guaranteeing
 * that an anchor cluster or a gap never draws shorter than its own touch-
 * target floor - and, critically, that nothing after a floored segment can
 * ever be positioned underneath it.
 *
 * The grid used to be laid out purely proportionally (a straight percent-
 * of-window-minutes conversion), with a pixel floor applied afterward only
 * as a CSS `min-height` on the rendered box. That floor could grow a box
 * past where its own proportional bottom edge sat, but nothing told the
 * *next* element to move - so a real gap shorter than about 38 minutes
 * (44px / 1.15px-per-minute) drew its floored box straight over the anchor
 * card that followed it. Short buffers under 38 minutes are common in a
 * real shift schedule, so this was not a rare edge case.
 *
 * The fix is a piecewise-linear map instead of a straight proportional one:
 * clock time is split into the same segments the grid actually draws -
 * the stretches inside an anchor cluster (touching or overlapping anchors,
 * packed into columns but sharing one vertical extent), the real gap
 * between one cluster and the next, and the one-hour buffer on each end -
 * and every segment is given at least its own pixel floor before segments
 * are stacked in order. A segment that already earns more than its floor
 * from real proportional time is left alone; one that does not is
 * stretched to the floor, and the stretch pushes every later segment down
 * by exactly the same amount. The result reads as an honest hour grid
 * everywhere nothing is too short to draw, and as a grid that made
 * deliberate room everywhere something was.
 *
 * Inside a cluster the floor is kept per block, not per cluster. A cluster
 * used to be one segment whose floor was its tallest column's stacked
 * total, mapped proportionally inside - so the fifteen-minute standup that
 * opens two hours of deep work got fifteen of a hundred and thirty-five
 * minutes of the cluster's 64px, seven pixels, and a title clipped to
 * nothing. `clusterSegments` cuts a cluster at every block edge and gives
 * each stretch the largest share any block spanning it needs of its own
 * floor, so a block's stretches add up to at least its floor whatever
 * shares a column or a minute with it, and the block after it starts below
 * that. Where nothing is short the shares are below the proportional
 * height and the map is the plain proportional one.
 *
 * `gapFloorPx` is passed in rather than hardcoded because a day with any
 * unsized anchor never draws a gap object at all (its real end is unknown,
 * so no gap around it can be trusted - see `computeTimelineLayout`'s own
 * comment) - the caller passes 0 for that case so a floor is never
 * reserved for a button that will never exist.

 *   implies a thinner density than the phone's own (a very short window on

 *   already guarantee no gap or anchor cluster draws under its touch-target
 *   minimum regardless of what density is requested here - this floor on
 *   the *base* density is a second, independent guarantee that the wide
 *   layout's own baseline reading never gets thinner than the narrow
 *   layout's, on top of that.
 * - **Never above `maxPxPerMinute`.** Without a cap, one anchor alone on a
 *   very tall monitor would divide a huge available height by a small
 *   window and draw as an absurdly oversized block - filling the screen
 *   was never a request to stretch a 30-minute call to 400 pixels tall.
 *

 *
 * `chooseWidePxPerMinute` (still below, unchanged) answers a different
 * question: how much of a *surplus* of room to spend. It floors at the
 * phone's own density, so a day needing more pixels than the screen has
 * simply overflowed and the page scrolled. That was the honest answer while
 * the grid sat in ordinary page flow. It is the wrong answer now that the
 * day view is a fixed-height shell, so this function is allowed to go below
 * the base density as well as above it.
 *
 * Solved by bisection rather than algebra because `computeVerticalLayout`'s
 * per-segment floors make total height a piecewise-linear function of
 * density, not a proportional one: each segment contributes
 * `max(minutes * p, floorPx)`, so the relationship bends at a different `p`
 * for every segment. Total height is still monotonically non-decreasing in
 * `p`, which is all bisection needs. Thirty halvings of a range a few
 * px-per-minute wide lands far below one pixel of drawn height.
 *
 * Two cases deliberately hand back `basePxPerMinute` untouched:
 *
 * - **Nothing measured yet.** An `availableHeightPx` of zero or less is what
 *   `useAvailableGridHeight` reports before its first layout pass, and what
 *   an environment with no layout engine reports always. Fitting a day into
 *   zero pixels would mean drawing every segment at its bare floor; drawing
 *   it exactly the way the phone does is the honest fallback.
 * - **Nothing measured yet.** An `availableHeightPx` of zero or less is what

 *   zero pixels would mean drawing every segment at its bare floor; drawing
 *   it exactly the way the phone does is the honest fallback.
 *
 * A day that cannot fit at any density is the third case, and it used to
 * hand back `basePxPerMinute` too, which was the wrong end of the range.
 * The floors are touch targets and legible-text minimums and are not
 * negotiable, so something has to scroll - but *how much* was a choice, and
 * the phone's density is the worst answer available. The starter template's
 * own nine-task day in a 445px column drew at 1082px: six hundred pixels of
 * scrolling for a day whose floors need 456. It fits its floors now, which
 * is eleven pixels of scroll, and it is what the sentence above always
 * claimed: the grid draws at its floors and something scrolls.
 *
 * Below the density where the first segment leaves its floor, every segment
 * is at its floor and the total does not move, so the fit is run again
 * against that minimum height rather than simply returning zero. Proportion
 * is worth whatever it costs nothing to keep: a two-hour block and a

 * Which hour marks are legible enough to carry their own "HH:MM" label at a

 *
 * Compressing a day to fit a screen (`fitPxPerMinute` above) can push whole
 * hours closer together than a line of 11px text is tall, and this app has a
 * standing rule that its text is always readable - two hour labels drawn on
 * top of each other break it. The *rules* are unaffected and still drawn at
 * every hour: position within the day is what the eye actually reads off the
 * grid, and a rule with no number beside it still says "an hour passed here."
 * Only the number is dropped, and only where there was never room to print it.
 *
 * ## It counts in a step, and the step is the same all the way down
 *
 * Until v2.18 this walked the hours and kept whichever one happened to be far
 * enough from the last one kept. That is correct about legibility and wrong
 * about reading: because this grid is not linear - free time is compressed
 * and a block is drawn at its real length - "far enough" lands in different
 * places in different parts of the day, and a real afternoon printed
 * 06, 08, 09, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 21. Nothing is wrong with any one
 * of those numbers and the sequence is unreadable: an axis whose step keeps
 * changing has to be read a number at a time, because there is nothing to
 * predict the next one from. The owner's words for it were that the hours
 * "are laid out badly", which is exactly what an irregular axis looks like
 * from the outside.
 *
 * So it counts in a step - every hour, or every second, third, fourth or
 * sixth - and takes the smallest step that fits everywhere. The step is
 * anchored on the clock rather than on the first mark, so the numbers are the
 * ones anybody expects to see: 06, 08, 10 and not 07, 09, 11.
 *
 * The greedy walk survives as the last resort, for a day compressed so hard
 * that even every sixth hour collides. It is worse to read than a regular
 * step and better than two numbers printed on top of each other, and the
 * rule that text is always readable is the one that cannot bend.
 *
 * **And no number beside a block's body.** The marks and the blocks are on
 * one scale - both are placed by the same map of their minute - but the
 * scale is not even, because a short block or gap is given the room it needs,
 * and an hour label standing beside the middle of a block is read as that
 * block's time. The owner's report, v2.24: a block from 13:30 to 15:00 "drawn
 * at the 14:00 mark", which it was, a third of the way down, where 14:00 is.
 * So an hour strictly inside a block is not a candidate for a label, and the
 * block says its own start and end; an hour at a block's edge still is,
 * because there it is exactly where the block starts or ends.
